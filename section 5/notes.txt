In CSS, some selectors take precedence over other selectors. For example, 
for a sentence havning both an ID and a class, the styling of the ID is 
applied over the class. 

Also, there is also inheritance in CSS. To eleborate, if there is an element 
inside other element, and if no particular style is applied to the inside 
element, then that particular instance of inner element will have the
styling properties of the parent element. 

How colours work? 
    - CSS comes with dozens of predefined colors. However, we can also define 
    our own colors. 
    - Some color names are aliases for other colors, such as grey and gray. 

What is RGB? 
    - An additive colour model that uses Red, Green, and Blue. 
    White is rgb(255, 255, 255)
    Black is rgb(0, 0, 0)
    Purple is rgb(128, 0, 128)
    - The range of RGB colors range from 0 to 255 inclusive. 

What is hexadecimal? 
    - Our common number system with base 16. 
    - ff is 255 for example. 
    - CSS colours can be represented as three pairs of hexadecimal, such as 
    #ff00ff meaning rgb(255, 0, 255)
    - So we can use a single hexadecimal number instead of three decimal 
    numbers, which is more succinct. 

What is HSL? 
    - Stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. 
    - It uses a cylindrical model to represent the colour space. 
    - The Hue is represented by an angle between 0 and 360. 
    - Saturation indicates how vibrant our color should be. 0 means we are
    at the centre of cylinder, and the colour is white and max means we have 
    max saturation. Represented in percentage. 
    - Lightness indicates the third dimension, where 100% gives us white, 
    and 0% gives us black.

    At a lightness of 50% and Saturation of 100%, we get the most saturated 
    version of given Hue. 
    - Purple in HSL is hsl(300, 100%, 25%)

Working with color opacity
    - RGB and HSL can make use of alpha channel, which represents opacity. 
    - rgba(128, 0, 128, 50%) is 50% transparent purple
