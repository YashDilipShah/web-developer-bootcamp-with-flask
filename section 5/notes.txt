In CSS, some selectors take precedence over other selectors. For example, 
for a sentence havning both an ID and a class, the styling of the ID is 
applied over the class. 

Also, there is also inheritance in CSS. To eleborate, if there is an element 
inside other element, and if no particular style is applied to the inside 
element, then that particular instance of inner element will have the
styling properties of the parent element. 

How colours work? 
    - CSS comes with dozens of predefined colors. However, we can also define 
    our own colors. 
    - Some color names are aliases for other colors, such as grey and gray. 

What is RGB? 
    - An additive colour model that uses Red, Green, and Blue. 
    White is rgb(255, 255, 255)
    Black is rgb(0, 0, 0)
    Purple is rgb(128, 0, 128)
    - The range of RGB colors range from 0 to 255 inclusive. 

What is hexadecimal? 
    - Our common number system with base 16. 
    - ff is 255 for example. 
    - CSS colours can be represented as three pairs of hexadecimal, such as 
    #ff00ff meaning rgb(255, 0, 255)
    - So we can use a single hexadecimal number instead of three decimal 
    numbers, which is more succinct. 

What is HSL? 
    - Stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. 
    - It uses a cylindrical model to represent the colour space. 
    - The Hue is represented by an angle between 0 and 360. 
    - Saturation indicates how vibrant our color should be. 0 means we are
    at the centre of cylinder, and the colour is white and max means we have 
    max saturation. Represented in percentage. 
    - Lightness indicates the third dimension, where 100% gives us white, 
    and 0% gives us black.

    At a lightness of 50% and Saturation of 100%, we get the most saturated 
    version of given Hue. 
    - Purple in HSL is hsl(300, 100%, 25%)

Working with color opacity
    - RGB and HSL can make use of alpha channel, which represents opacity. 
    - rgba(128, 0, 128, 50%) is 50% transparent purple


What is box model? 
    - It determines the overall size and shape of an element on the page. 
    - Made up of : content area, padding , border, and margin. 
    - Can be viewed in the inspector. 
    - So if we want the element to have final width of 300px, we need to to:
        Final width = width - vertical borders - vertical borders
        Final height = height = horizontal borders - horizontal borders

    - This can be really fiddly, so that's why the alternative box model exists. 
    - The size of element in alternative is calculated as 
        content size + padding + border 
    - Margin still calculated separately, since it separates elements  from 
    each other. 
    - Using alternative box model for all the elements is recommended. 

    For one element: 
    .element {
        box-sizing: border-box;
    }

    For all elements: 
    *, 
    *::before, 
    *::after {
        box-sizing: inherit;
    }
    body {
        box-sizing: border-box;
    }

    - Everything we've talked about applies only to elements being displayed as
    blocks. 
    - For inline elements, 
        ~ We can't set explicit width and height, these are set by the content. 
        ~ We can't create spave above and below them with padding, margin, 
        or borders. (left and right still works though)

CSS Units
    - Pixels
        ~ In terms of hardware, a pixel is light-emitting unit capable of 
        displaying full colour independently of its neighbours. 
        ~ In CSS, there a degree of scaling so that high pixel density displays
        still display objects at an appropriate size. 
    - Percentages 
        ~ Generally used for values relative to a parent. 
        width 50% means 50% of parent's width. 
        ~ Other times, percentages can be relative to the element itself. 
        ~ Or used in more absolute terms, such as for colours. 

    - em 
        ~ em is defined as being the same as the point size of the font. 
        ~ So if font-size is 16px, then 2em is 32px. 

    - rem 
        ~ rem stand for root em
        ~ It's generally more useful, since it's more consistent. 
        ~ It used the global font size to determince it's size. 

What is specificity? 
    - A mechanism used by browser to determine which property declarations are
    applied. 
    - The selectors of a property determine the specificity weight. 
    - The property with highest weight, wins and is applied to the element. 
    - If there's a tie, the order matters (latest wins)

    - The weighting system: 
        ~ Different types of selector contribute differently to overall 
        specificity. 
        ~ A selector with higher weight beats any number of selectors with 
        a lower weight. 

BEM 
    - What is BEM? 
        ~ A CSS methodology and a naming scheme.
