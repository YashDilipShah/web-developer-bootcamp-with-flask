This is the file in which I am put all the important notes that are general in
for this course. 

Website Basics: 
    1. First and foremost step is conversion of url into a IP address using
    a DNS. For example, google.com can be mapped to 190.142.5.136 or similar. 

    2. For frequently visited sites, most OS and routers maintains a local
    cache of such name resolutions. 

    3. Once the name is resolved, the browser sends an HTTP request to the 
    server with all the relevant information. The server, in turn returns the
    most appropriate page, or error code. 
    404 and 200 are common error codes, meaning the required resource doesn't 
    exist and that request is successful but no resource is present respectively. 

FrontEnd VS BackEnd 
    1. FrontEnd means all the content that the user interacts with and sees on 
    his browser windows. This is sometimes also called the client side code. 

    All the HTML files, CSS files, images etc are contained in the FrontEnd. 

    Browser compatibility is an important part of FrontEnd Development, as 
    different browsers may interpret code differently. 

    2. BackEnd is the other side of the coin. Whenever user does something 
    that issues a request to the server, then that thing can be called a part 
    of BackEnd. 

HTML
    HTML is a markup language, that is used to describe the structure of the 
    website. 

CSS 
    CSS is for describing the look of the webpage. It decides how to page will 
    look to the user. 

JavaScript 
    JS is a full fledged programming language, that most browsers understand. 
    That makes it unique, because of that, it can be used for many complex
    applications. 

Inspector Tool
    We use many different tools while developing, but one of the most common
    tool is the Inspector Tool that comes with almost all the browsers nowadays. 

    We can add or delete elements in the site using the Inspector, and also
    view the performance related stats. 

    It is important to note that, whatever changes we make in Inspector, are 
    limited to our browser. If we reload the website, it will remove all the 
    changes that we have made.
