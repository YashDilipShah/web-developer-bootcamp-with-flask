1.      HTML document is made up of elements, that describe that page's content 
and structure. It may contain images, videos, buttons, etc. 

2.      We write all the information between elements and tags. HTML tags are 
of different types and different tags have different properties. 

3.      For some complex structure, we may have to nest multiple tags together. 
One of the most tag is <p>. or the paragraph tag. It is permitted to have content 
inside it. 
<p> This is an example of paragraph </p> 

4.      Some HTML tags also accept attributes while opening them and this allow 
us to specify some properties of that tag 
<input type="number", required  />

5.      Now that we have the index.html ready, to change the default style of
the page, we need to use CSS. Let's have a look at that. 

6.      CSS is made of selectors and properties. Selectors select what aspect
to modify, and properties are the properties that we want to change in the 
file.
