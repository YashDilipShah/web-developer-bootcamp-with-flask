1.      HTML document is made up of elements, that describe that page's content 
and structure. It may contain images, videos, buttons, etc. 

2.      We write all the information between elements and tags. HTML tags are 
of different types and different tags have different properties. 

3.      For some complex structure, we may have to nest multiple tags together. 
One of the most tag is <p>. or the paragraph tag. It is permitted to have content 
inside it. 
<p> This is an example of paragraph </p> 

4.      Some HTML tags also accept attributes while opening them and this allow 
us to specify some properties of that tag 
<input type="number", required  />

5.      Now that we have the index.html ready, to change the default style of
the page, we need to use CSS. Let's have a look at that. 

6.      CSS is made of selectors and properties. Selectors select what aspect
to modify, and properties are the properties that we want to change in the 
file. 

7. Some of the most common HTML elements:

    > span : 
        ~ Generally used to annotate small pieces of text, because we want to 
        assign some different style to them. 
        <span> Text </span>
        ~ Very generic element, with no semantic meaning. Use it as last
        resort. 
        ~ It can be used for multitude of purposes, but it is better to 
        avoid it as much as possible, for the same reason, because anyone else 
        reading the code will have no idea what it means. The best thing to do 
        is to search for a specific HTML element for the purpose and use span
        only if such doesn't exist. 

    > a : 
        ~ "Anchors" used for links and one of the most important elements. 
        <a href="google.com"> Go to Google! </a>

    > li (lists)
        ~ Lists are used to list some elements in the webpage. The most common
        lists are ol and ul, that ordered lists or unordered lists. 
        <ol>
            <li> element 1 </li>
            <li> element 2 </li>
            <li> element 3 </li>
        </ol>

    > form 
        ~ Forms are one of the most vital elements, and it is used almost
        everywhere. 
        ~ It is so commonly used, that there are a host of elements just 
        for forms. We will see them in detail as we go on. 
        ~ The two most important attributes of form are action and method. 
        action decides where to send the data and method decides the type of 
        HTTP request, which is generally post, or even get in some cases. 

        <form action="/login" method='post'>

            content

        </form> 

    > img 
        ~One of the several elements used to display images. 
        ~ It doesn't have a closing tag, and only have one required attribute, 
        src which specifies the path, or the URL of the image. 
        ~ But it is generally advisable to have alt attribute, providing 
        some information regarding the image. 

        <img
            src = "https://placekitten.com/200/300"
            alt = "A cute fluffy kitten."
        />

8. Something about the container elemnents:
This elements are designed to contain more elements inside them. Let us look at
them. 

    >section
        ~ Contains thematically related elements. 
        ~ The section element is a part of the whole and used to divide the 
        page into multiple parts. 
        ~ Generally sections contain a heading. 

        <body>
            <section>
                <!-- Merch Items -->
            </section>
            <section>
                <!-- Blogs -->
            </section>
        </body>

    >article 
        ~ Self contained composition (makes sense on its own)

        <article class = "forcast">
            <h1>Weather forecast for Seattle</h1>
            <article class= "day-forecast">
                <h2>03 March 2018</h2>
                <p>Rain.</p>
            </article>
            <article class = "day-forecast">
                <h2> 04 March 2018</h2>
                <p>Periods of rain. </p>
            </article>
            <article class="day-forecast">
                <h2>05 March 2018</h2>
                <p>Heavy rain. </p>
            </article>
        </article>

    >div
        ~Very generic, so useful for grouping
        ~Mainly used to aid in styling content. 
        ~They are somewhat similar to span, and thus, should be used sparingly. 

    >header
        ~ For introductory content
        ~ Header bars with logo and navigation. 
        ~ You can use header inside section and article, to put the title and 
        other information. 

    >nav 
        ~ Major navigation blocks in the site. 
        ~ Often inside the header when it is used as a header bar. 
        ~ This is most commonly used when you have a group of links that 
        you want to use as navigators. However, this is not the appropriate 
        choice, if you want have some reference links to outside pages. 

    >main 
        ~ The main content of the document or page. (What is unique to 
        that particular page)
        ~ Only 1 per page, inside the body. 
        ~ For backward compatibility, include a role attribute inside it. 
        
        <main role = "main"> 
        </main> 

    >footer 
        ~ They are there to provide some additional information about the 
        parent element. This may include social media links, secondary 
        navigation, site smallprint. 
        ~ You can use footer inside articles or sections, but they should be
        related to the parent element! 


9. What is semantic HTML? 
    i. What are we trying to describe? 
            HTML is used to describe the meaning of the page's content. 
            In other words: the role of a block of content in the context of the
            whole document. 
            HTML is not for describing what a looks like - like colors, sizes, 
            shadows etc.. 

            Although, even if we don't provide any css, all elements look different
            and that's because browser applies some default styling to every 
            element.

            There are some specifiers in HTML for basic styling, like <b> for 
            bolding the text, but you should avoid using HTML for visual 
            effect. 

    ii. Who are we descri the content for? 
            HTML is for computers to read. 
            Computers turn the HTML into things the user sees!
            HTML is also vital for things like screen readers, where good markup
            can make navigation much easier. 

    Thus, USE HTML TO DESCRIBE THE CONTENT and USE CSS FOR STYLING.
