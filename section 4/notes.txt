1.      HTML document is made up of elements, that describe that page's content 
and structure. It may contain images, videos, buttons, etc. 

2.      We write all the information between elements and tags. HTML tags are 
of different types and different tags have different properties. 

3.      For some complex structure, we may have to nest multiple tags together. 
One of the most tag is <p>. or the paragraph tag. It is permitted to have content 
inside it. 
<p> This is an example of paragraph </p> 

4.      Some HTML tags also accept attributes while opening them and this allow 
us to specify some properties of that tag 
<input type="number", required  />

5.      Now that we have the index.html ready, to change the default style of
the page, we need to use CSS. Let's have a look at that. 

6.      CSS is made of selectors and properties. Selectors select what aspect
to modify, and properties are the properties that we want to change in the 
file. 

7. Some of the most common HTML elements:

    > span : 
        ~ Generally used to annotate small pieces of text, because we want to 
        assign some different style to them. 
        <span> Text </span>
        ~ Very generic element, with no semantic meaning. Use it as last
        resort. 
        ~ It can be used for multitude of purposes, but it is better to 
        avoid it as much as possible, for the same reason, because anyone else 
        reading the code will have no idea what it means. The best thing to do 
        is to search for a specific HTML element for the purpose and use span
        only if such doesn't exist. 

    > a : 
        ~ "Anchors" used for links and one of the most important elements. 
        <a href="google.com"> Go to Google! </a>

    > li (lists)
        ~ Lists are used to list some elements in the webpage. The most common
        lists are ol and ul, that ordered lists or unordered lists. 
        <ol>
            <li> element 1 </li>
            <li> element 2 </li>
            <li> element 3 </li>
        </ol>

    > form 
        ~ Forms are one of the most vital elements, and it is used almost
        everywhere. 
        ~ It is so commonly used, that there are a host of elements just 
        for forms. We will see them in detail as we go on. 
        ~ The two most important attributes of form are action and method. 
        action decides where to send the data and method decides the type of 
        HTTP request, which is generally post, or even get in some cases. 

        <form action="/login" method='post'>

            content

        </form> 

    > img 
        ~One of the several elements used to display images. 
        ~ It doesn't have a closing tag, and only have one required attribute, 
        src which specifies the path, or the URL of the image. 
        ~ But it is generally advisable to have alt attribute, providing 
        some information regarding the image. 

        <img
            src = "https://placekitten.com/200/300"
            alt = "A cute fluffy kitten."
        />
