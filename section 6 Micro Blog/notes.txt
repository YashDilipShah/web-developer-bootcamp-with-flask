The 5 prime steps in software development: 
    - Become a User (or have one in team)
    - Populate the Backlog with help from the user. 
    - Make the working software. 
    - Review and Change the plan according to need and suggestions. 
    - Improve your process.

The usual databases, or SQL databases, there are tables, and all the data is 
stored in tables. These tables are linked together by primary and 
foreign keys. 

To extract data from traditional databases, SQL is used, and the relationships
between data is used to specify which data to extract. 

As opposed to traditional SQL, NoSQL databases are different. MongoDB which 
we will be using in this course, is also a NoSQL database. For these databases, 
each different database comes with its own method for querying the data. 

Databases using varying ways of storing data to provide a variety of benefits.

MongoDB doesn't use tables with columns, but instead it uses collections with 
documents. The key difference being, in tables, each row is of same type, 
for example, if there are 10 columns, then you will know that all the rows 
will have 10 entries. But that is not the case with MongoDB. 

In MongoDB, each document in the collections can be different and can contain 
different data. It is not bounded or restricted by anything such as the case 
in SQL databases. 

So, what does a document in MongoDB look like? 
    - It looks something like 
        {
            _id : ObjectId("172384"), 
            username : "Yash", 
            contact : {
                phone : "12345678890", 
                email : "something@somethingelse.com"
            }, 
            access : {
                level : 5, 
                group : "dev"
            }
        }
    
    - It is basically like JSON or somewhat similar to Python dictionary. 
    - The _id field is an required MongoDB field, which is required to identify
    the document.  
    - The document may contain sub documents, which is the case in the field
    contact in above example. 

Benefits of MongoDB
    - More flexibility since there is no fixed schema. 
    - This can lead to faster development times. 
    - Data storage is similar to python dictionary, so it lends itself
    well since less code is needed for mapping data. 
    - MongoDB's scalability model is straightforward. 

Drawbacks of MongoDB
    - No native JOINs. You can join manually with python code, but performance
    is much worse than native SQL joins. 
    - Storing the key name for each field in every document results in 
    high memory usage. 
    - There are limits to the size of documents and amount of nesting within
    documents.
