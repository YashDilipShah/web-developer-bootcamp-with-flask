In this section, we will deploy our app on Heroku, so whole world can 
use it. 

The first thing we need to do, is tell Heroku, what dependencies our app uses. 
These includes all the modules and packages that are needed. 

For that, we create a file calles requirements.txt, and write all the dependencies
in it. You don't have to put all the dependencies, rather, you just want 
to write the dependencies that you are using, or manually installed in the 
venv. 

If you are using conda, you can easily make the requirements.txt file using 
conda list --export > requirements.txt
